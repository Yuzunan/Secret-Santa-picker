# Secret-Santa-picker

Created this tiny project in 2023
My friends and I were organizing a Secret Santa, and I wanted to created a script to assign
a Santa to each person.

There is a script for the draw, creating a file with the result encrypted,
and a script to login in, to give to the user the result of their own draw,
so they know whose Santa Claus they are in the group.

Only default is that the code itself must be changed if a person wants to join or leave,
and the person writing the code needs to know each password, since it's hardcoded.
