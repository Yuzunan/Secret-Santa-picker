# Secret-Santa-picker

Created this tiny project in 2023
My friends and I were organizing a Secret Santa, and I wanted to created a script to assign
a Santa to each person.

Only default is that the code itself must be changed if a person wants to join or leave,
and the person writing the code needs to know each password, since it's hardcoded.
